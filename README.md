## What's Google Foobar
Google Foobar called foo.bar, is Google's secret recruiting process embedded within their search engine. 
There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges that follow a story.

The system has been used by Google for at least a year and is triggered when a user enters certain search terms relating to coding languages like Python and Java. The search results page breaks open to reveal the message "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?" to which the user can decline once, request the message isn't shown again, or click "I want to play".
